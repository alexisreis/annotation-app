# ðŸ”¨ Build and deploy

When you are happy with the changes you just brought and you wish to build a production version to test it on a server just use this command :&#x20;

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build your version into the `client/build` directory. Then just copy this directory into a sevrer and you are good to go.&#x20;

More deployment information are available at the [`create-react-app` documentation website.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment)
